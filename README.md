# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms. It uses historical stock data for analysis and builds models to forecast future prices. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluating multiple predictive models.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Demonstrates loading stock market data and preparing it by addressing missing values, scaling, and creating new features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data with graphs and plots to reveal trends and patterns.
- **Model Training**: Trains various models, including linear regression, decision trees, and, if applicable, advanced models like LSTM.
- **Prediction & Evaluation**: Assesses model performance with relevant metrics, comparing predictions to actual stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Presents prediction results visually through line charts and other plots.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the notebook:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (for LSTM or other neural network models)

Install them using:
```bash
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow

```
## Data

The notebook uses historical stock data with columns:

- **Date**: The date of each stock price record.
- **Open**: The price of the stock at market opening.
- **Close**: The price of the stock at market closing.
- **High**: The highest price the stock reached during the day.
- **Low**: The lowest price the stock reached during the day.
- **Volume**: The total number of shares traded on that day.

The dataset can be sourced from APIs such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other stock market data providers. Alternatively, you can manually upload a CSV file containing this data into the notebook.

## Usage Instructions

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Notebook**: Launch the notebook in Google Colab or your local Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. **Load the Data**: Ensure the stock price dataset is accessible and correctly referenced in the notebook. If using an API, make sure you have configured the necessary API keys.
3. **Run Preprocessing Steps**: Execute the data preprocessing steps to clean and normalize the data, handling any missing values, feature scaling, and transformations.
4. **Model Training**: Train the stock price prediction models provided in the notebook. Adjust hyperparameters and model configurations as desired to experiment with different setups.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess model performance.
6. **Prediction and Visualization**: Generate predictions for future stock prices and visualize them using the notebook's plotting functions.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned by handling missing values, normalizing features, and transforming date features into formats suitable for time series analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features, such as moving averages, rolling statistics, or lag features, are created to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Train and evaluate models such as:
   - **Linear Regression**: A simple model for predicting stock prices using historical data.
   - **Decision Trees**: An advanced model that captures non-linear relationships in the data.
   - **LSTM (if applicable)**: A deep learning model well-suited for sequential time-series data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
5. **Visualization**: Plot actual vs. predicted stock prices for visual comparison and analysis.

## Results

The models trained in the notebook generate predictions for future stock prices. Model performance is assessed using the following metrics:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
- **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model fits the data.

The notebook includes visualizations comparing predicted and actual stock prices, providing a clear view of model performance.

## Customization

The notebook is designed to be flexible and customizable for different datasets and use cases:

- **Replace the dataset**: Upload your own dataset or connect to a different stock market API for real-time data.
- **Change model parameters**: Modify hyperparameters like learning rate, epochs, or tree depth to optimize performance.
- **Feature engineering**: Add or remove features based on specific needs, such as additional technical indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Bollinger Bands.
